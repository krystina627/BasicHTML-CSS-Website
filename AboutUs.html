  <h1>History</h1>
  <p>Members of the Pasadena, MD area started this non-profit volunteer organization
    because they kept hearing their elderly neighbors and family members complain about
    having to give up their gardens due to health issues or growing age concerns. After
    talking to local churches and organized clubs around the area Second Chance Gardens
    was able to find enough volunteers and board members to make our dream a reality. We
    have volunteers from all over the community helping our organization, such as church
    youth groups, members of the boy’s and girl’s scouts, and walk-in volunteers from just
    about every age bracket in the community. We are able to supply all gardening material
    and plants to the seniors due to generous donations from local nurseries, business owners,
    and other members of the community.</p>
    <p>If you know a senior in need of some help or your a senior yourself that
      needs some help please contact us to talk to a representative
      and schedule an appointment</p>
